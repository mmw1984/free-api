# Free AI APIs
This repository contains a list of free to use APIs for several AI models. This repository is based on vortex's project but he stops continuing his repository (I think?)

## List:<sup>*</sup>
<sup>*: This list, sorted by amount of "✅"-emojis, solely covers known free providers for various AI. If your service is paid, exclusive, associated with bad figures, or does not offer the idea of 'free *GPT-4*', it will not be listed. **Make sure to read the disclaimers below**.</sup>

<sup>1: NSFW allowed under special /unfiltered/ endpoint.</sup>\
<sup>2: Has not explicitly banned the usage of the API for NSFW. </sup>\
<sup>3: These services *do* have GPT-4/stability, but the free versions available are not particularly reliable or currently available.</sup>\
<sup>4: It's Claude-1, but the difference to 2 isn't huge.</sup>\
<sup>5: Too slow and unstable. Sometimes, there is no request</sup>

> [!NOTE]  
> A lot of the services also support specific models for donators, but we are **just including the free tier** here. Some of these services give you rewards over time etc., but I'm assuming here that you only have ~10 mins of time. Moreover, we're assuming, the user wants to request the according model 5/minute and 50/hour; for gpt-4-32k and similarily expensive models 10/hour. Moreover, the timeout for a simple prompt like "1+1" is 10 seconds, images: 30 seconds (medium quality), 40 seconds (high quality).
